## Fibonacci

The algorithm fibonacci calculates the n-th Fibonacci number iteratively using a loop. It initializes variables fibNMinus2 and fibNMinus1 to store the two previous Fibonacci numbers, and fib to store the current Fibonacci number. It then iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) and calculates each Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers (fibNMinus1 and fibNMinus2).

The algorithm updates fibNMinus2 and fibNMinus1 in each iteration to keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers. Finally, it returns the n-th Fibonacci number, which is stored in the variable fib.
